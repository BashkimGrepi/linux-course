## a) 
First I chose upCloud for my server platform. I did my account and put my information details  
![login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/836a1835-64d8-4925-8609-fc185dc5bf59)
Then I need to select the correct operating system. For me it's Debian
After that i followed Tero's instructions and it was time to create my ssh key.

![ssh-generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6df72f8d-f123-402d-b429-27806d59ff0e)
then I copied the generated public key and pasted it to my upCloud 
after that my server is ready to be initialized and debloyed. 
![depbloy-server](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edcb5082-d2db-4f98-8c89-f06db8b3b19b)
Remember to copy your IP address

## b) 

okay now we are ready to set up the firewall but before that we need to allow ssh to fire wall by command sudo ufw allow ssh. Then we can install and enable the firewall
![install-firewall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48bb3f79-2901-40ed-b707-49cfda60c084)
You chan check if it's active by command sudo ufw status

lets create a user for our server 
![creating user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e72afec-8d28-4a49-a8b9-bf850b500778)
make the user its host
![hosts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae3de9c0-a41c-4630-bc9c-23c8ef5a3d69)

lets start enterig our server with ssh key![ssh-login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/056d0737-00b0-4e82-9644-20131c4ae32f)
as you can see we are in the server now
![server-login-works](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e272a83f-fb14-400d-8ae5-2ef45c882c22)

we need to copy our ssh key from root to our server
![ssh-copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/527d31ad-c67b-45f0-b691-979b2d79f4cb)
there you can see  from where we have copied to where

## c)
Lets isntall apache2 on our server with command **sudo install apache -y**. We can make sture it's installed by running command **sudo systemctl status apache2**

Korvaa oletussivu joka sijaitee /var/www/html/index.html. Itse laitoin vain **<p> how are you </p>** Lets test are the changes active. by writing our servers ip address in url search
![hihowareyou](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82072f52-a869-43f7-b9a7-29801363f35f)

Now lets create new virtual host konfigurationfile
![nano-mypage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48adbd5b-1e75-4132-b9be-f9e58353f4fd)

then I added these rows in there 
![cat-uusi example com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8c0720c-6446-4032-9146-ca11abb363c1)

Lets copy our html file to this file, but first we have to create it
![mkdir_mypage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1c2be0d-3b0f-440b-92f6-6c94bc554e3b)

then we copy the content from html folder to the new mypage forlder
![cp_mypage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/180be01d-ea1d-40ac-b712-3058e3ded2c5)
Now we can see that we have the default site enabled also so we need to dissable it
![sites-ebabled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc12a3cc-e5b5-427a-b564-c6597bd45787)
with two commands it's dissabled and restarted
